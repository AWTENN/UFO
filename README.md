# UFO

## Overview

- The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage so that we can sift through data related to UFO sightings through the date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.

## Results

- Here is how to use the different search criteria to look up specific UFO instances.
- For the Date field, you must enter in a date in the format of 1/10/2010: 
- For the City field, you must enter in a date in the format of a lowercase city name: 
- For the State field, you must enter in a date in the format of a lowercase state initials: 
- For the Country field, you must enter in a date in the format of a lowercase country initials: 
- For the shape field, you must enter in a date in the format of a any shape(some shapes may not work): 


## Summary

- One drawback to the date field is  the format only allows “1/10/2010” which could slow down searches. Two recommendations I would make would be to have an autocomplete feature where typing in one letter or one month/day brings up some information, and I think we need more data because we only had a limited amount of data for this webpage.
